    summary: "Videogamers can tackle NPCs by trying again and again, but what occurs to them when they battle online?",
    content: `Once upon a time, a saint was granted a wish about whatever his apprentices and their successors will be unique at shall get such type of power. After few centuries, people started forgetting about them and not recognizing their powers. In 21st century, a child with less physical potential but extra ordinary guts existed. His college life had just started. But neither was he rich in terms of friendship, nor in accounts. What he had were guts and loser gaming skills. Since he never had friends, he always gossiped with himself and called it fourth wall breaking. He too had a favorite teacher in his teenage. Not because that teacher was kind or friendly but due to hardworking and how strict to all the teacher was. That teacher wasn't aware of his own power to have profits ever in life decisions making. And similarly, his teacher, and teacher of teacher .... were given different powers which they all didn't use because they weren't aware of it. The kid with guts too got a peculiar kind of superpower. But powers could only be used in a very life-threatening situations which never came to any of the teacher's life.

An archaeologist was digging up all this history to find the truth of his thesis. A sacred book in hidden temple contained all its information, which he finally found. Now, he started linking the people who passed away weirdly and were extra ordinary. One after one, he got to know about this kid. But as soon as he could continue his research, some commandos with strange uniform took him in a portal where a man was waiting for him. The man was actually the variant of kid from an altered timeline who had same powers as original timeline kid. Using his powers, he built a city to rule upon, whose civilians were his slaves trapped in that location. But the archaeologist had a backup. He transferred all the research data in his latest invention of AI drone to search the kid and avoid kid's variant who was stronger. This variant was learning different techniques involved in enhancing his powers, when he used the serums that temporarily boosted them but decreased his permanent potential. Since then, the variant wanted to steal original one's powers and keep ruling his kingdom.

After escaping his dimension, drone started finding that kid. Finally, it somehow reached the kid which seemed to be a loser who was struggling and facing numerous challenges to live. But his hyperactivity disorder made him isolated. In order to wake the powers, the drone attacked the kid, but the kid survived without using them. Next time, kid got unconscious but still no powers seemed to come up. Drone now doubted if the kid was him or not. But actually, the inherited power was saving him from being noticed by his variant. As soon as he used any powers, the variant could sense it to track him. To save the kid, the drone confronted him. He understood the concept in a second but lacked confidence upon his potential. He had bigger potential examples to be chosen for the power. But the drone had no time to explain why he was more than any of those examples. So, it him to a nearby railway and asked to try out. To do this, he closed his eyes and laid down on the track. Unlike before, he experienced dream of playing Temple run this time. After he stood up from the dream, he saw that the train went through him and the drone couldn't remember if he even laid. The same also happened before when the drone tried awakening his powers. The effort he did in his dreams used to change the reality, lasting him alive. This all was strange and didn't make much of sense at that moment. By discussing different memories, they both came to know that his powers are playing videogames. Any suitable video game runs in his dream, where he wins and reality changes accordingly.

To understand this concept better, he chose some of his favorite emulator and pc games. Learning from craft mode in Minecraft, cheats in GTA vice city, passive abilities in Free Fire, he upgraded his skills more and more. But his variant sensed his training soon. So, he too worked on taming skills against his skills, like processor lagging against Minecraft, Claude/CJ from other GTA games and paid subscription in Free Fire. Now the variant was ready to steal powers of kid. He travelled to main timeline in that midnight while kid was sleeping and silently sat on a chair observing carefully the same face as him. The kid suddenly sensed someone 's presence near him and woke up. This made the variant say (Darr Gaya? Mujhe bada maza aata hai jab koi dar jata hai , pata chalta hai ki usse apni jaan ki fikar hai , aur jise jaan ki fikar ho, maa kasam maarne kaa mazaa ussi ko aata hai ) . Changing the expression to smirk, the kid mocked with (takkk..... Huhhhhhh....!!!!! ). Within a few seconds, the reality of room shed into a dark purple world, and everything faded including the drone. Both got engaged in first battle as Tekken 3 game where kid chooses Eddy Gordo, and Variant chooses Jin Kazama. After a tremendous fight, Jin Kazama turns into devil (accessing Tekken 5 options) and defeats the Eddy. Such upgrades were not accessible by kid yet. So, for next battle kid entered in Swordigo 's character and Variant entered in the character 's master whose soul had helped the character in game. This master was accessible of more than 6 kinds of energies, more than 10 lives, and more than 5 trinkets. Even if the kid had good skills in game, the dimension rift was not harming variant 's master due to one of the trinkets. The kid lost again.

Now to the final round, the kid chose to be the Ethan of Pokémon Crystal, and Variant chose to be Red. He defeated all the Pokémons of Ethan easily. But somehow the battle didn't end. Variant was furious about the rules of game, suddenly everything came back to starting where the Pokémons of Ethan had full stats and full HP and similarly with Red. The Variant realised that kid wasn't playing real Pokémon Crystal on GBC machine, but in emulator app on some other device, which has extra features of quick save and quick load. Now, the strategy to win wasn't by defeating all the Pokémons of Ethan, but to drain the kid's energy until kid feds up enough to not load again. The kid lost in that battle more than 100000 times, but didn't gave up, because he had learned not to fed up with any situation while catching one of the rarest Pokémons. While, the kid had enough guts to not fed up, the Variant was exhausted by making the same efforts and defeating all Pokémon again and again. He understood why he couldn't check his future in timeline, because quick save and quick load may never allow him to win. The variant not just accepted his defeat but also sacrificed in guilt to underestimate the real one. Although, people could never sense that someone protected them from whom and what abomination was about to occur. The kid then went back to his life. Drone too started to find other apprentices chosen by the powerful teachers.`,

    summary: "Puberty is incomplete without infatuation in it, but can somebody win against such strange feeling?",
    content: `In the competitive environment, the kid was facing so much depression and failures. Even his life started being same as before, because he again had no one to talk to. The drone was on journey to explore more apprentices in world. After so much hard work in his Induction program, taking time for studies which  weren't started yet and compromising precious time of developing new bonds, the fruits bearded on tree of those who weren't worthy of it. Writing theories could not energize the kid anymore. But finishing them felt him relived until the problem stepped his doors back. It was the ring of the girl which just became his ex a month ago and was the first one to mock with kid in 18 years. There were some crushes in the kid 's past too but he proposed none.

Now, after one month, she had called him to continue her torture. And he obviously had no choice other than picking up call. She immediately apologized for her behavior and excused that it was too early for her to decide it in those days. She swore to her mom that she loves him so much that she broke up with her ex for him. After so many convincing tries, the kid couldn't resist and fell in the trap again. The studies were now on a fast track, and time spent on her disturbed his entire schedule. He lacked dreams in his sleep cycle now, which meant that his powers were disappearing. An intrusive thought of him doubted the girl is power inherited too. He sent all the details of girl to drone and asked to investigate about her. In some days, drone found that people of nearby villages call a vigilante as Infatuator. She had to be this. After reporting it to kid, he had no time to waste upon. He used some powers that he learned from his variant 's last battle and paused time.

Then he teleported himself to her home 's location, which was a haunted castle instead. After entering in it, realities shattered again. The space got enlarged equal to region of city. The girl appeared from black sky slowly and said (Kya Hua babu) as a smirk, and the battle started with round one, where our hero tried to fail her by looping in quick save/quick load again, but before he could quick save the stats of his Pokémon, she chose Skitty and infatuated his Pokémons. Now, after quick save, the
infatuation was so strong that it was impossible to win against Skitty. And fed-up possibility didn't even work after 5 turns because the emulator buttons too lacked working because of vision loss on kid 's infatuated state. It was a losing round, so next round was based on a non-gender-based game, which kid decided as Plants VS Zombies. Here, the zombies and Dr. Zomboss were in command of girl, but she infatuated crazy Dave who opened secrets to tackle any plant. Those Gaurantars smashed each lane and ate up all brains.

The third game that kid chose after a deep thinking was Granny. In this game, she could easily defeat him. But she was surprisingly unsuccessful. It was because, to play Granny, one must take risks and must not fear. The person who has no fear, lacks emotions which results in loss of infatuation. Now the
only option with girl to win other than infatuating him was by not letting him escape her house. But the person who watched Granny Videos of Gaming Engineer won't lose at all. After winning final round, he gets to know that she was cursed (and not granted this power) by a man with powers because she didn't sense his pure love and bullied him. The curse was that her ghost will keep suffering and absorbing powers of all apprentices until someone defeats her against her own infatuation. She had defeated 4 apprentices already. Now her soul can leave this world peacefully. Kid was now about to return but drone called him to meet someone important.`,

    summary: "A real hero does not require any superpowers to save anybody, but can Videogamer pass this test?",
    content: `After attending meeting with drone, the kid thought that he would be meeting some sidekicks. But it was actually the creator who granted powers to first saint. The Videogamer wasn't supposed to get popular according to creator. The creator warned him not to use powers unnecessarily and vanished. In the evening, a report came from nearby city that a government orphanage was going through zombie apocalypse. Kid immediately went to that region through terraces of buildings and started using Minecraft creative mode where zombies could not affect him. 

But a rich senior girl made a vlog of his fight. She was able to see all of it because of his reality manipulation logics. Generally, to tackle specific life-threatening situations, his brain crafts a safest suitable dimension to face it in. But Minecraft uses Earth itself that made his dimension to remain the original place. It took him 2 days to clash with the entire zombie wave. While all seemed to be safe now, the Creator was furious to see kid coming in front of other's attention. So, He seized kid's powers and left the timeline. 

Even after losing powers, he hid under the bed at a nearby apartment. But kid was happy as at least the town was safe from zombies. But unexpectedly another zombie wave appeared from outcasts of city. The Government had already rescued everybody except that bully girl who was the daughter of minister. She got unofficially permitted to shoot the situation of town. She was the only cause of creator's temper. Kid neither could nor wanted to help her in those moments. But he came up with an idea that if the zombies get distracted by someone else then she may be able to escape. 

Drone could manage to distract the zombies if that wave hadn't been deaf or blind. But those zombies only followed the human aroma and human temperature only. The kid had no other solution at that moment other than entering the streets and running in opposite direction. But since his childhood, Zombies have been his biggest nightmare. But there was no time to fear. So, he stood up, opened the doors to step out and screamed to attract them. As soon as they started chasing him, the girl left town successfully. But within no time, the zombies caught kid and ate him alive like barbarians leaving bones and blood behind.

The bully girl heard about death of Videogamer who sacrificed himself for her next day. Creator felt guilty for taking wrong step and revived the kid back in last night with powers. The kid ended up all defeating all zombies again. In reward, the creator granted him to use his powers irrespective of situation and free of his will. Meanwhile, Drone got to know that a famous awarded writer recently named Aryansh is also one of the gifted ones with powers. His powers were to run and change the world by programming timeline's simulation and altering its codes.`,

    summary: "Whenever we feel aggression towards somebody, we desire to get an opportunity to catch him alone somewhere. A place where no one is around other than us, but what if somebody's dream come true?",
    content: `There was once a college student named Atom who had crush on her ex-classmate named Pandey from past 5 years. They both had passed their matriculation exam from same school and were tough competitors of each other. Pandey was more than average in all subjects whereas Atom was all section topper in case of mathematics - science and barely passed in other subjects. He was very introvert and arrogant man. He went to different school for higher studies and got separated from Pandey. But he got her contact somehow. During online conversation, Pandey was amused to discover that he behaved as a friend rather than a competitor. But after realizing that she feels ashamed to meet him, he called her even unworthy of friendship and blocked her no. Things got a little messed up when he saw the same girl in the college, he took admission in. He never preferred talking or even noticing her at all.

One day, both get mysteriously teleported to a fictious white empty room. Their clothing was transformed to a uniform which contained white shirt, simple jeans and a pair of inner wears. They had nothing as a substance with them and were unknowingly teleported in this strange dimension. She immediately started screaming and shouted for help whereas Atom started to think of what just happened. It was actually one of the evenings of their busy schedules, when Atom had gone to his college laundry facility and Pandey was having a walk with her friend outside. While waiting in laundry's queue, he noticed that Pandey was judging his looks and expressing pity. Therefore, someone who might wanted a kind of entertainment brought them in this dimension. 

After screaming for hours, Pandey asked Atom what happened, but Atom ignored her and kept thinking a way to escape successfully. He assumed this as a survival situation for which he was conservating energy. The white room had its four walls at an angle of 108° with respect to floor. Now Atom got an idea and tried to climb on the wall because the roof seemed to be made up with 30 - 40 LEDs sufficient to escape by breaking through. Pandey called him crazy for trying that stupidity and waited for him to fall. As he gradually climbed to half of the height of wall he unwillingly fell because of suffocation and exhaustion. Pandey then slept whereas atom kept trying to climb wall the whole night. 

When she woke up sneezing, she found that Atom was observing the door carefully. This was the only door of room with no keyhole or handle but a fist sized hole near the wall of door. The mechanics seemed to be locked from outside but upon touching the outer surface of door through the hole of wall, Atom gets to know that the door was completely smooth, plane and handleless from both sides. Because of starvation and thirst, Pandey was feeling irritation. She was shouting on Atom and also blaming him for all this. She wanted to see him react and for that she called him the most insensitive man on earth. He then suddenly got struck with another idea and used his jeans zip cut out as make-shift tool for cutting the door mechanics. He held both the ends of cutout from behind and front of the door using the wall hole. But due to loss of energy and starvation, he was no more able to trim the lock of the interface. He then remembers that his incisor tooth is not real (real one was lost in one of the fights with his big brother in corona lockdown) and if broke out, can be used as tool to increase size of wall hole. He broke his tooth by plucking hard and Pandey got horrified of this. But this idea failed again because the incisor depleted to dust when used to dig. Pandey lost hope of escaping and accepted her fate. 

But Atom with a tense expression came to her saying that he figured out a successful escaping plan. The plan was to sacrifice of one of them for the other to run away. To escape, they needed food as well as tool which had to be nothing but the remainder. He said that he was ready to sacrifice himself, but Pandey called him mad and asked him to calm down. After a long discussion, she fed up to accept his idea because of insane starvation pain. He prepared by getting his head a smash on wall. The blood stream came out of his head, and he started feeling dizzy, but repeated the process and fell down on floor with blood all over white shirt and white floor. Pandey mourned and feared to eat his meat but later on finished him. As expected, it took Pandey 3 weeks to escape successfully using his bones as tool and went back to her life.

Suddenly, atom soul watching it all got teleported in front of the real mastermind behind this. The man described him that he got the power of initiating a battle between two people in a white room where no one's superpowers or unity, even not that of himself could intervene until the other died and white room stained with blood. Only then could the winner escape, and he got the powers by battling in same condition too. But got shocked to see how two people carrying so much hatred for each other can sacrifice for them too. Now he wanted Atom to be the successor of powers and granted him. But the very first kill Atom did using powers was of this man for what he did to both. Finally, he returned to his life hiding his powers.`,

    summary: "False accusations carry big chances to engulf innocents, especially when one doesn't have proof or witness to defend himself, but how will such situations affect Atom's abilities after the incident of white room?",
    content: `After Atom's comeback, many of the reporters and his parents asked the story behind it. But Atom was worried about Pandey 's state of mind. He lied to everybody that this all was done by Videogamer using any room escape game for taking fun out of us. Since no one knew who's behind the mask of Videogamer, they left the topic and answered Atom that Pandey is being kept in a mental health care for her treatment because no one believed her and thought that she might have been harassed which led to a great shock. Since Atom got a reasonable story, they all could leave Pandey. But telling her that Atom is alive was difficult. Atom wanted to do this himself.
But before he could do that, Police caught and imprisoned him in the case of abusing Pandey. The FIR was registered by Pandey 's parents who thought that Atom physically abused and tortured her such that Pandey couldn't recover from that trauma. Even in court, by giving proofs of Pandey feeling scared by Atom 's name, lawyer proved that Atom was guilty. Atom was not only being imprisoned for his 40 years of his life, but his parents were being criticized by society too. His brother couldn't become a doctor now. 
Atom was frustrated by the disaster him and his family were facing. He consistently had flashbacks of the past the whole day and night. It was not such that he couldn't teleport himself, but he had no solution to free his family from society pressure. Meanwhile, he had been getting headaches a lot in jail. It took him a week in jail, until one morning during bath, he had flashbacks again till suddenly his eyes closed. He brought the consciousness of nearby prisoner to look into his memory for 5 seconds. The near one when came out after 5 seconds ran away calling Atom a psycho. Whereas Atom got fainted after then. His ears bled a little too. Doctors said that his brain is certainly weird. His reports came out normal but blood coming out of his ears made no sense.
 Atom realized that the powers are getting enhanced to a level where he can show his memory to someone's consciousness and may even trap the same in white room. He asked a favor to the prisoner of helping him in training who faced that memory early morning. When the prisoner denied, Atom threatened him that he will trap prisoner in another dimension if he didn't help. Now, trying to experience the enhancements, he was able to show desired memories to prisoner. On second trial, he was barely able to teleport prisoner 's consciousness into the white room with him. But that room no longer remained white. It looked purple this time. Within seconds, he had fainted again. Doctors this time said he seriously needed to be taken under observation. 
But he wanted to reopen the case and prove that he wasn't guilty. The other prisoner made everyone believe that he had such powers and his case must be reopened. He already had lost much blood from his ears and was in hurry to run to court. But doctors weren't letting him escape. So, he used more of his effort to teleport them in a white room and went to court. After watching him getting bled from ears and nose heavily, everyone resisted his escape but weren't successful. He managed to visit the judge and used all his remaining will to show judge 's consciousness the memory of what happened earlier. It was his peak moment when completing the memory, his head exploded, and blood stained all over on judge, nearby things and floor. 
The judge after this hearing stated that Atom wasn't guilty and commanded to free Pandey from mental health care and that parents of Atom can now appeal case in court of being defamed. The dead body of Atom was sent to a mortuary. After 1 year and 4 months of lying dead on stretcher, Atom opens his eyes and finds himself locked in mortuary room. It meant that he had been healed by someone for some specific mission.`,

    content: `India, a land of ancient traditions and democratic evolution, quietly gave rise to a man whose very voice could bend wills. Yuvi, a reserved yet observant boy, discovered during his early childhood that he possessed a superhuman ability—any command he spoke would be followed without question. Whether it was a whisper or a shout, when Yuvi dictated, people listened… and obeyed.

But this wasn't a power he flaunted. At his parents' request, he made a solemn promise: until he turned 18, he would not use this gift. And so, Yuvi grew up in silence, watching the world unravel in chaos—corruption, social media addiction, poverty, religious violence, and unchecked capitalism. As others saw a flawed but functional democracy, Yuvi saw a system failing its people, choking on its own freedom.

On the day he turned 19, Yuvi broke his silence. Without warning, he entered politics at noon, and by nightfall, he was declared President of India, toppling the government without a drop of blood—just a few spoken words. The media was paralyzed. Protesters froze mid-chant. Parliament members resigned in masse. The world was stunned. Yuvi had arrived.

He wasted no time. Democratic rights were dismantled overnight. The Constitution was rewritten, and martial law was imposed without resistance. Yuvi's first announcement was the formation of three supreme departments:
•	The Food Security Directorate,
•	The National Shelter Mission,
•	The Income Assurance Bureau.
Every citizen's life would revolve around these three sectors. Meanwhile, all non-essential industries were either banned or restructured. Brands promoting entertainment, fashion, junk food, and tourism were obliterated. Streaming platforms, sports channels, and even public gaming were prohibited for anyone above the age of five.

He criminalized betting, stock marketing, investment platforms, and banned ads that promoted materialism. Billions worth of inventory—snacks, liquor, energy drinks, and intoxicants—were incinerated. Shockingly, even Indian tea, a cultural staple, was outlawed due to its addictive properties.

Yuvi didn't just dictate laws—he dictated morality. In a controversial nationwide address, he declared that any visible cleavage must be covered by saris, and skirts were replaced by full leggings or pants for all women. Vulgarity, he claimed, was the silent poison of the modern world. His rules were harsh, yet framed as protective. Those who resisted—whether journalists, actors, or religious leaders—were either imprisoned or publicly humiliated by his loyal enforcers. News channels were forced to broadcast these events in full detail, but Yuvi wasn't hiding it. He wanted the world to see the cleansing.

Section 295A, once used to protect religious sentiments, was overturned. In its place came new laws under Section 82, making religion a personal liability. All places of worship were shut down or destroyed. Citizens were given an ultimatum: "Abandon your religion—or abandon your life." Religion was erased from IDs, passports, and school forms. India became a forcibly secular nation.

Meanwhile, he ordered the reconstruction of the national syllabus. Traditional education was thrown out. Students were now trained based on practical capability and passion, not exams. He introduced a new employment model—one job for every citizen, no unemployment, no resumes. From janitors to judges, everyone was placed based on a national skills test, designed by Yuvi himself.

But Yuvi was thinking long-term. He wanted a successor free of flaws. Using IVF technology, he had a son—raised not in luxury but under the watchful eyes of ancient monks in China, secluded from society. The boy was to grow into a symbol of balance: power with humility, control with compassion.

Years passed. Under Yuvi, India became the most economically stable, technologically advanced, and globally feared country. Crime was nearly wiped out, the GDP soared, and poverty dropped to historic lows. His legal reforms centralized the justice system under his own review. No lawyer, no judge, no jury—Yuvi was the court.

Yet, one enemy remained—Zark Muckerberg, the elusive founder of the most toxic social media platforms on the planet. Yuvi blamed Zark for destroying the attention span, discipline, and moral fabric of society. But reaching Zark was impossible. Despite Yuvi's dictatorship status, Zark lived behind walls of encrypted technology, AI-driven security, and satellite-controlled defense systems. Every assassin, sniper, and spy Yuvi hired failed.

Then came the turning point.

Zark, seeking leverage, kidnapped Yuvi's son from the monastery in China, unaware of the storm he was about to unleash. The kidnapping was both a challenge and a threat: Zark wanted to take Yuvi's throne and globalize the new empire with technology at its core.

Negotiations were brief—and bitter. Yuvi demanded his son's release and the shutdown of Zark's platforms. But Zark, arrogant and emboldened by his technological empire, refused. In a moment of cold calculation, Zark issued a final blow:
"If your world can't be ruled by reason, then it deserves a sacrifice."
The boy was executed.

Yuvi was shattered. But devastation gave way to wrath. His fury transcended grief. The time for diplomacy was over.

In a final showdown, Yuvi confronted Zark, revealing powers far beyond anyone's imagination. Zark's reliance on artificial intelligence became his downfall. He underestimated the man who ruled not with tools, but with voice and presence.

Yuvi spoke one final command:
"Walk the Earth until your death—without stopping, eating, or drinking."

Zark, unable to resist, began walking endlessly, bound to a fate worse than death. The world watched in horror and awe.

From that day onward, Yuvi was not seen merely as a tyrant or savior—he was feared, revered, and remembered as something beyond a man. He became "The Dictator", the one who silenced democracy, eradicated religion, broke society's chains—and rebuilt the world in his own image.`,

    content: `In 1921, a cosmic superhero on the verge of vaporization decided not to go down quietly. After sneezing mid-flight and dislocating his own knee while dodging a sneeze comet, he stuffed his powers into a jar of rainbow-colored candies and hurled it into deep space. The jar flew past a space whale, bounced off Saturn's rings, and finally crash-landed on Earth by smacking a seagull so hard it did a cartwheel. Down on the ground, Noe-Chu, a legendarily unlucky boy, was tripping over a signboard that said "Caution: Slippery Luck Ahead." The candy jar ricocheted off a lamppost, bonked his head, and rolled into the storm drain. A chain reaction of absurdity followed—Noe-Chu chased the jar, slipped on a crusty samosa, and fell into the gutter, only to emerge an hour later wearing it as a helmet. That night, after eating beans and losing Wi-Fi, he finally popped one candy in rage and BOOM—he was suddenly floating, shiny, and labelled with a golden chest plate that said: Mr. Effort. Unfortunately, his first heroic act was falling off the roof while trying to pose heroically.

Noe-Chu quickly learned his powers didn't follow logic—only extreme misfortune. His teleportation triggered by stubbed toes. Fire control? Only when he sneezed near chili powder. He could fly, but only if launched from a trampoline by mistake. He became famous overnight for saving people by accident. Once, while running from an angry goat, he tripped into a moving popcorn cart that rolled into a power grid, which short-circuited and diverted an electric surge from a nearby hospital. Lives saved. Another day, a burning building collapsed near Charmy, the girl he liked. While trying to eat a candy in secret, he choked, flailed into the street, and knocked over a construction crane. The crane fell in such a way that it blocked the fire, forming a slide for people to escape. He ran to Charmy, covered in cement and pasta sauce from an earlier encounter with a food truck, and managed to escort her out. Hero of the day? Yes. Did he know what he was doing? Absolutely not.

Things took a twist when Professor Yoshimitsu, the bitter science teacher with the hairstyle of a bored pineapple, decided he couldn't let random luck beat actual science. After failing to win a Nobel Prize for inventing "edible magnets," he created a laser that would cancel probability-based powers. The weapon was powered by used batteries and concentrated jealousy. When Mr. Effort went to stop a runaway train powered by confused donkeys, Yoshimitsu zapped him midair. Mr. Effort's chest plate blinked, glitched, and changed to say "Mr. Sloth." Immediately, he lost control, flopped into the mud, and caused a wild domino effect: a pile of banana crates fell, spooking nearby cows, which ran into a billboard that toppled over a slope and triggered a landslide. Noe-Chu tried to roll away, but a candy fell from his pocket, both him and the candy were buried beneath rocks, dust, and the remains of an ice cream truck. No one saw him again. Over time, his body, fused with the candy jar, was slowly encased in hardened amber-like soil—his final unlucky pose frozen like a superhero statue doing jazz hands.

Nearly a century later, in 2023, a group of geology students on a field trip accidentally discovered the amber fossil while one of them was digging with a selfie stick. They thought it was an ancient warrior, or possibly a fossilized mime. Inside the amber, they saw a boy, mid-sneeze, gripping what looked like rainbow candy. When one student tapped it with a rock (because "rocks beat everything"), a crack formed, then shattered dramatically—knocking one student off a ledge and freeing Noe-Chu's perfectly preserved body. One candy rolled out and instinctively fell into Noe-Chu's open mouth. Instantly, his fingers twitched. His chest plate flickered from "Mr. Sloth" to "Buffering…" to "Mr. Effort" again. He coughed up 100 years of dust, sneezed so hard the students' camping tent flew into orbit, and blinked at the wide-eyed crowd. "Where's the bus stop?" he croaked. Birds scattered, one student fainted, and another just started clapping. Within minutes, news broke that an ancient superhero had been revived—by accident—by students who were only trying to avoid writing their thesis.

Now awake in the modern world, Noe-Chu found himself famous again, but confused by modern slang, terrified of touchscreen phones, and deeply allergic to oat milk. Every attempt to use his powers ended in physical comedy: he tried stopping a robbery by slipping on a spilled juice box, which flung him into a shelf of pineapples, which then distracted the robbers long enough for mall security to arrive. Airdropping a villain from the sky? He tripped on a dog leash and fell onto the villain's car just as they tried to escape. The world labelled him a "Glitch Hero," and the geology students started a podcast called "Unearth This," featuring his weekly misadventures. Noe-Chu, still unlucky, now wore a new version of his chest plate—not shiny gold, but dented steel with one word blinking beneath dust and fingerprints: "Retrying…" And somehow, that felt right.`,

    summary: "Before the Truman Show or TVA, Mr. Effort had already experienced the life of being trapped in reality manipulation. But risking unruled dimensions for breaking your own strings, does that make sense?",
    content: `Writer Noe Chu, had always been a bit of an average guy in his world. He wasn't aware of the powers he held—until, one day when something strange happened. He had been writing a story while travelling back to his college, as he often did, about his own superhero characters—like Noe Chu aka Mr. Effort, whose superpower was being lucky. He got struck an idea to introduce that Mr. Effort could break the fourth wall and be aware of his existence within the story from now. It seemed like a fun twist, something to spice up the narrative. To do this, he inserted a scene of his own meetup with Mr. Effort in this journey. What he didn't expect, however, was for his writing to somehow drag the real-life Mr. Effort—into his world.

Without any warning, Noe Chu found himself sitting right in front of the Writer, looking at him like he had just walked into the wrong place at the wrong time. Confusion swirled in Noe Chu's mind—was this some sort of joke? Was he being pranked? He couldn't understand how he had ended up in a completely different world, staring at the very person who had written the life he had been living.

The Writer, equally bewildered, stared back at Noe Chu, and there was a long moment of silence. Noe Chu, who was always calm in chaotic situations, couldn't hold it in anymore. He exploded, demanding answers, furious at the realization that his entire existence had been written into someone else's narrative.

It was difficult to grasp—his entire life, his struggles, the relationships that had been severed, and the pain he had endured, were all part of a story someone had crafted for him. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. The Writer, still trying to stay composed, explained that Noe Chu's life had been shaped by the story he had written. All of Noe Chu's desires, his heroism, his battles—they had all come from the Writer's imagination. In a way, he had given Noe Chu everything he had never had in his own life. But Noe Chu wasn't buying it.

How could his life be reduced to just some plot point in a book? How could someone decide his fate, making him live through endless battles, long separations from his family, and sacrificing his happiness for the sake of a grand narrative? He couldn't accept it.

The Writer, somewhat unfazed, tried to explain that Noe Chu's heroism was not without purpose. Sure, people had died—some innocent, some not—but that's the cost of being a hero. Noe Chu had saved millions, and that alone made him indispensable to the story. In the Writer's world, heroes had to make tough choices, even if it meant sacrificing some lives. Noe Chu was supposed to be the one who took on the pain of those losses to ensure that the world was better. That was the nature of story writing.

But Noe Chu wasn't having it. He wasn't okay with the idea that people had died just because the Writer decided it would add depth to the plot.

Then, as the argument heated up, the Writer casually asked Noe Chu what would happen if he lost his powers—what if Mr. Effort no longer had the ability to save the world, to be the hero? Would Noe Chu be okay with that?

For the first time, Noe Chu paused. The thought of losing his powers wasn't as terrifying as he had expected. Maybe it would be a relief. Maybe he was done with being the one who always fought, always saved the day, and always carried the burden of responsibility. Mr. Effort was tired.

He didn't need the powers anymore. He didn't want to be the hero forever. And honestly, Mr. Sloth had caused much chaos in his world already. He hated the idea that his entire existence had been dictated by the whims of the Writer, and the notion of being free from that was oddly appealing.

The Writer, sensing an opportunity to drive home his point, warned that if he stopped writing, the balance of the universe would collapse. Villains would rise. Time would unravel. Without the Writer, Noe Chu would never know what chaos would emerge. It would be far worse than anything Noe Chu could imagine.

But Noe Chu, becoming more sardonic by the second, shrugged. Let it all collapse, he thought. After all, what good was a world where someone else controlled everyone's fate? Why should the Writer be the one to decide who lived and who died?

But the Writer wasn't ready to give up so easily. He argued that without Noe Chu, there would be no moral compass, no one to hold the villains in check. The hero's role had to be filled, even if it came with pain. And if Noe Chu stepped away, the consequences could be catastrophic. In the middle of their heated exchange, passengers noticed a constant rhythm that was coming out of something nearby.

A man shouted upon all to maintain silence so that he gets no difficulty to locate origin of source of that sound. It appeared to be a Tik-Tik noise from the Writer's backpack that was placed in the rack of bus. They all started screaming that it is a bomb. No one wanted Writer to utter even a word. In the panicked situation, the bus driver tried to slow down, which led to fastening of the rhythm from that backpack with people's heartbeat. Mr. Effort explained that it could be a motion catching bomb, as long as the bus runs, it won't burst. 

People believed him and asked him for solution. But to him, convincing Writer mattered more. Writer started feeling humiliated and irritated because all the passengers started staring at him. In fury, he frankly denied to give up writing and claimed that the power chose him for this purpose. As he said this, he took out his pen to send Noe Chu back without his powers this time to be safe from any attempt made by Mr. Effort in future. But pointing his clutch pen a detonator, Mr. Effort snatched it from him. 

In disbelief and fear, the passengers picked Writer from his seat and threw him out of the moving bus. Noe Chu couldn't help but chuckle. The mighty Writer, scrambling around like a cartoon character, slipping and sliding on his own mess. Now the bus was free of button detonation, but still under high risk of any bus break which may cause blast. Meanwhile, Writer was critical but still alive, lying on the road. With a bunch of broken ribs and bones, Writer was left with single agenda- to kill Mr. Effort. 

So, using his bleeding finger, he tried to write- NO MORE MR. EFFORT on the road. But suddenly, a rash driver crashed his car upon Writer, knocking him down finally. This driver was none other than Sevlon Bhoi. In panic, he stepped out of car to confirm if it's not a deer again, and in calm voice whispered that at least this time, Bishnoi gang won't be after him again.

However, tensions rose within passengers as the Tik-tik sound remained clicking. They started praying to Mr. Effort for a solution. Believing in his own powers, he started shooting imaginary invisible plasma ray on the bag-pack using his hands. The next moment, driver announced that the fuel was exhausted. As the bus slowed down, the sound started speeding up.

And with the bus coming to a break, the noise faded too. Turned out that the Tik-Tik was the sound of bag's zip constantly hitting the rod of bus rack instead of any bomb. During change in speed, breaks or turns, the increase in bus vibration used to increase the number of hits by zip per second. After realising the truth about it, they felt foolish murdering the innocent Writer, and vowed that a secret won't go beyond the windows of that bus from now on.

The secret was- Noe Chu aka Mr. Effort is not of their universe. They all pretended that Noe Chu is none other than his own variant aka Writer. Left with his powers of Luck, and the ability to break the fourth wall, Noe Chu decided to continue living—pretending to be the Writer, saving people, and hoping that someday, he would return to the world where he truly belonged.`,

    summary: "When ambition defies nature, even miracles bleed consequences. But can redemption truly follow after tampering with life itself?",
    content: `Once, there existed a professor and his diligent student, bonded by an extraordinary vision: to transcend the natural limitations of life and death. Together, they worked to develop a biological theory that could resurrect the deceased, locate perfectly matched organs for transplantation, and even engineer alternate methods of human reproduction. Their relentless research yielded numerous groundbreaking surgeries and medications that revolutionized treatment methods. Yet, they remained unsuccessful in discovering a comprehensive solution that encompassed all these ambitions.
Over time, the professor's resolve began to wither. Disillusioned by the limitations of their progress, he eventually abandoned the pursuit. In stark contrast, the student pressed forward, unwavering in his commitment—even as the journey consumed nearly every aspect of his life. After eight gruelling years, he devised a solution that could unify their fragmented ideas: human duplication. He then spent an additional three years constructing a machine capable of bringing this theory into reality.
News of his innovation spread rapidly. The idea of duplicating a human being captivated the public imagination. People lauded the student as a genius and eagerly awaited the debut of the world's first successful human duplicate. The professor, however, was thrust into obscurity, overshadowed by the acclaim directed at his former protégé.
When the professor learned of his student's triumph, bitterness consumed him. What he perceived as betrayal festered into a desire for vengeance. Secretly, he orchestrated a brutal assault: he dispatched a group of goons who ambushed the student, struck him on the head, fatally wounded his clone, and disposed of both the duplicate and the machine by casting them into a river.
The next day, crowds assembled with great anticipation, eager to witness the living proof of human duplication. But neither the student nor the clone appeared. Disappointment turned into silence, and soon the world forgot the once-promising man who had nearly changed the course of human history.
The student, however, had survived—barely. The blow to his head had caused severe trauma, rendering him comatose and wiping his memory. For six years, he remained unconscious in a hospital, unrecognized and forgotten. When he finally awoke, he was a man without a past. Slowly, he rebuilt his life, marrying, raising a child, and eventually resuming his work as a scientist, unaware of his former identity.
Meanwhile, in the river where the clone and the damaged machine had been discarded, a catastrophe was brewing. Due to a critical malfunction in the compromised device, a phenomenon began—an infinite "blood glitch" that continuously generated blood. The river became saturated, turning water supplies into thick, crimson currents. Attempts to purify the water proved futile; even distillation failed to remove the contamination. As global water sources were compromised, humanity was forced to extract water from the atmosphere—though even this yielded a faint reddish hue.
The contamination spread to the skies, where the evaporated blood particles turned clouds red and the atmosphere ominously crimson. Amidst the chaos, the professor exploited the crisis for profit by launching a macabre business: converting the tainted blood-water into consumable food.
But nature retaliated once more. A virulent pathogen began to breed within the contaminated waters, triggering a deadly pandemic. Victims numbered in the millions—including, eventually, the professor's own granddaughter. Faced with this personal tragedy, the professor's heart turned from greed to desperation. He realized that the only person capable of solving this crisis was the student he had once betrayed.
Lacking any knowledge of the student's current whereabouts, the professor engineered a teleportation device, theorizing it could locate and retrieve the student across dimensions. The device was untested and highly volatile. Despite warnings, he activated it.
It worked—but not as intended. The teleportation device locked onto the student and transported him into an alternate universe, leaving the professor behind. it meant that the professor had built a multiversal portal instead of a tracker. It took him four years and seven months to reconstruct a new teleportation system, this time with improved precision. He now understood that the origin of the calamity—the blood glitch—was the duplicate and its malfunctioning machine still submerged in the infected river.
Efforts were made by governments and other institutes to retrieve it, but none could survive the bio-contaminated environment. Only the original scientist, whose DNA matched the clone's, could safely enter it. At last, the rebuilt device successfully brought the student back from the parallel universe.
Upon his return [after the events of COLLAB 1], the scientist recounted a harrowing tale: the world he had been teleported to had suffered a zombie apocalypse, one he had inadvertently caused through similar experiments. Haunted by the devastation he had seen and desperate to reunite with his family, he was now determined to right the wrongs of this world.
With grim resolve, the scientist dove into the crimson river. Deep within its depths, he located the damaged machine and his lifeless duplicate. Overcome by emotion, he grieved what had once been his greatest achievement—and his greatest failure. Knowing what had to be done, he destroyed the duplicate and dismantled the machine, finally halting the unending blood glitch. From his own DNA, he engineered a vaccine that neutralized the virus spreading through the contaminated water. In the aftermath, the truth emerged. The professor, once considered a visionary, was exposed as a saboteur driven by envy.
 The scientist was finally recognized for his brilliance and integrity. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his life-saving work—though strict regulations were imposed thereafter: human duplication was forbidden. Only the replication of specific organs for medical purposes would be permitted moving forward. And so, the scientist resumed his life—not just as a pioneer of modern biology, but as a man who had stared into the abyss of his own creation and returned to mend it.`,

    summary: "Some echoes of the past are best left unheard. But can defying laws of nature in conviction lead to disaster by its own saviors?",
    content: `When Atom stood up, he saw a man who was the cause of his resurrection. The figure, dressed in sterile gloves and exuding surgical detachment, introduced himself as Reviver. There was nothing ceremonial about him—his name reflected function, not identity. He claimed the ability to revive the deads and repair the heaviest wounds of any creature no matter what. And now, under command, he had revived Atom to assist in a task that would demand just that.
The task originated from Yuvi. The former dictator, once a voice that could bend the wills of entire parliaments, now moved with quieter conviction. His son had died—brutally and irreversibly—and there remained no trace of his body to reconstruct from. Reviver could rebuild the form from scratch, but not from void. The only source of precise behavioural geometry resided in Yuvi's memory.
That memory needed to be extracted, and for that, Atom was necessary. His consciousness-transfer ability, already dangerously refined by past experiences, could retrieve memory at a resolution more precise than anything artificial could offer. Yet the process had proven lethal before—he had died from it once. Still, under Yuvi's dictationary command, there was little option to refuse. 
The lab they prepared was austere. Reviver stood poised beside the extraction chair, ready to receive the memory glimpses. As Atom readied himself, he noticed a small scar on Reviver's forearm when he had met Reviver half a day ago—a rounded indentation, shallow but glitchy. The response, when questioned, was dismissive, a reference to a minor animal encounter. But the explanation failed to settle. 
Atom, without alerting either companion, slipped into a brief scan of Reviver's memory. What emerged did not belong to their world. The fragments were steeped in unnatural light—blood-streaked streets, distorted figures, and settings that seemed corroded by something deeper than time. These were not dreams. They were lived realities, but from where, Atom couldn't determine. 
Unnerved, he withdrew and quietly informed Yuvi. Reviver appeared unaware of any such past. With no clarity on what had been discovered, the revival was postponed. No confrontation followed, only an uneasy mutual silence.
Time passed. Then Yuvi returned, this time with new precision. The revival process was to continue, but the variable would change. He had summoned a scientist with quiet readiness. This was the same man who had been unintentionally brought into their universe by the Professor's earlier miscalculation, but the others had no reason to know. To them, he was simply a physicist and a bio-engineer capable of delivering results with impeccable skills.
Under Yuvi's instruction, the scientist cloned Reviver. The result was structurally identical, devoid of the scars or memories that had raised concern. The clone waited, inert but capable. The original Reviver remained on-site, offering no argument, only assistance.
Atom resumed his role as conduit. Yuvi settled into position, and the process began. As Atom connected to Yuvi's memory field, the presence of the original Reviver steadied him. His last attempt had left him unconscious and bleeding; however, this time, the sensory weight was partially lifted by the Reviver's stabilizing influence.
Yuvi's memories unfolded. The image of his son emerged—not just in face and voice, but in the minute complexities of his behaviour. Atom extracted with precision. But something else surfaced, quietly, from within himself. It was not emotion, not even conscious thought—just a residual sorrow, deeply embedded and long-ignored. The weight of Atom's past—the White Room, Pandey, the prison—had never fully settled. 
As the stream passed through him, that darkness slipped into the data. The cloned Reviver accepted the transfer and began reconstruction. At first, the results were unremarkable. The form assembled, breath returned, eyes opened. Then, without warning, the body vanished.
Surveillance systems caught movement within the city's transit tunnels. The heat signature was inconsistent—spiking, collapsing, erratic. The team dispatched. What they found in the station left no doubt.
A man lay partially devoured, his chest collapsed, his face unrecognizable. Nearby stood the resurrected boy, barely human in posture, his presence too warped to be dismissed as trauma. Yuvi attempted to intervene using his voice, but it failed to register. The boy was beyond instruction—he was not resisting command; he was incapable of receiving it.
The brain of very beast-looking boy was dead. Without hesitation, Atom responded. Both he and the boy disappeared from the station. They had entered the White Room.
Inside, the distortion fell away. The creature appeared to be in his original form, like a human again. The White Room, governed by its law of power nullification, reduced them to their original physicality. The boy, now restored to mental clarity, grasped what had happened, even if the details were elusive.
He understood the nature of the space. He grasped the rules. Atom wouldn't need to explain. The boy recognized that if Atom died within the room, he himself would exit—and resume what he had become.
There was no drawn-out decision. The boy acted with clarity and finality, accepting what had to be done. But Atom wanted to save him, and pretended to be confident upon the skills of his team members and their technical advancements. However, kid could sense the possibility of his true resurrection. This led to a massive argument between them, where Atom was convincing kid to stay alive and Atom could be brought back by reviver, whereas the boy was insisting him to let go. After failed convincing each other, both went for aggressively resisting each other's suicide attempts. 
But due to extra-ordinary martial art training, the boy dominated his intentions upon Atom, sacrificing himself by entangling Atom and plucking his own neck's crucial vein simultaneously. When Atom returned alone, Yuvi said nothing. His silence confirmed what words would've only distorted.
No further efforts were made. The failed revival was laid to rest—not through denial, but through quiet acknowledgment. Yuvi arranged his son's final rites without spectacle, without ritual. There was no anger. No blame. Just a lesson.
Before the mission had ended, the clone Reviver had performed one last act—an automated gesture of healing. The man who had been attacked in the subway had been restored. Reassembled. Brought back.
He had fled. No one followed. No records were kept. The man disappeared into the chaos of the city. But for Atom, Yuvi, Revivers and the scientist, the disaster had gone under-controlled . They had each returned to their own roles—fractured, but functioning. The clone had joined research projects of scientist and went along with him. Whereas Atom returned to his college life, manipulated to on-going student life by Dictator on all the citizens around Atom.
But this wasn't over yet. The man who had been healed was still infected and started spreading zombie virus in outskirts of a city, the Videogamer lived in. This led to zombie apocalypse which he later on tackled.`,

    summary: "We all long to explain ourselves to the ones we care about—but what if those explanations aren't just words, but weapons? And what if silence isn't peace, but a trap waiting to ignite?",
    content: `Following the aftermath of the MINI COLLAB incident, Atom began to suffer from relentless nightmares in which the spirits of the deceased accused him of their deaths. Alongside these nightmares came vivid and disturbing visions of an alternate version of reality. In this distorted timeline, Atom, during his 12th-grade year, attended chemistry tuition in a location where the adjacent house belonged to a man secretly affiliated with an underground local organization. This group was involved in the unlawful breeding and sale of dangerous dogs, particularly Rottweilers, leading to numerous deaths across the country.

In that altered reality, Atom had an altercation with the tuition teacher's neighbour over a dog, an encounter that escalated when the dog bit Kusam, a fellow student. Though the dog in question was not a Rottweiler, the incident prompted Kusam's parents to take legal action against the neighbour. Shortly afterward, a staged terrorist assault was carried out at the tuition centre. This mock siege turned the students into hostages, with Atom and Kusam being isolated in a separate holding cell. There were no guards present, no food supply, and no outside assistance.

The real purpose behind the attack was to pressure Kusam's parents into withdrawing their complaint. Inside the cell, the situation mirrored the strange, unnatural conditions that were characteristic of Atom's powers and the phenomenon known as the WHITE ROOM. Just like in those mysterious conditions, escape was impossible without a severe cost. Kusam managed to escape with the help of Atom's bones and aid in rescuing the other students, but Atom, unlike in other scenarios, possessed no abilities in this version of the timeline—and he was dead.

This timeline appeared to perfectly prevent the events of MINI COLLAB, which haunted Atom in his dreams. These dreams made him question whether his survival in the original timeline was the reason for the chaos that unfolded. He began to wonder whether his death might have been the necessary sacrifice to stop the apocalypse.

Despite the mental burden, Atom moved forward into his next semester. As the new academic term began, he was shocked to see Kusam—now an NRI—enrolled in his very batch. The coincidence struck him as uncanny, but he kept his emotions guarded. His batchmates often told tales about his odd behaviour around campus. Many treated him as a joke, spreading rumours that he consumed drugs during lectures or was a chronic womanizer. Yet, a few defended him, clarifying that he had never even spoken to a girl, let alone had any kind of intimate relationship.

One such rumour—that he kept a weed pouch—was debunked when a sick classmate was offered the supposed contraband by Atom, which turned out to be licorice, bitter to the taste. Over time, despite the gossip and speculation, one fact became clear to all: Kusam seemed to be closely observing Atom. Strangely, he kept his distance from her and most women in general. Even Pandey, another classmate, had a conversation with Kusam where she admitted her past emotional instability, promising not to dwell on earlier events.

Kusam's persistent presence made Atom uncomfortable. Eventually, he filed a complaint. However, the oddity of the situation led the faculty to downplay it. They encouraged Atom to remain composed, suggesting he be supportive of foreign students for the college's reputation. Their paths crossed again when they were paired for a group project by an assessment teacher. During this collaboration, Kusam confided in Atom, revealing that her entire family had perished during the MINI COLLAB disaster.

This revelation struck a chord with Atom, who empathized with her loss and extended the hand of friendship. Yet, this friendship was unconventional. They did not share meals, hang out, or even acknowledge simple social cues. Kusam hesitated to shake his hand, fearing rejection. Their rapport was more silence than connection.

One day, while both stayed late in the lab and were packing up their belongings, Kusam leaned toward Atom in an apparent attempt to kiss him. Atom, caught off guard, recoiled and pushed her away. As confusion and tension surged, the world around them seemed to fracture. Atom began to suspect his uncontrollable powers were once again resurfacing.

But the twist wasn't supernatural—it was orchestrated. Kusam confessed that she had been preparing for this moment. She claimed Atom's nightmares were not illusions but echoes of reality. She spoke of a dream she had a year prior in which her deceased grandmother visited her. According to Kusam, this dream explained that reality had been tampered with due to infinite time resets performed by someone called Videogamer. Her grandmother had allegedly revealed secrets about the origin of their powers. Kusam's grandmother, known for her role as an arbiter of truth aka Lawyer, had once been associated with her brother aka Psycho who passed on powers to Atom. This man and the grandmother had opposing philosophies, and after a major dispute, they separated.

Kusam was asked by her to avenge her family. Her grandmother's powers were passed to Kusam in that dream, and she began tracking down the heir to the opposing force—Atom. Believing that only Atom could access the strength needed to stop Videogamer, Kusam crafted a long-term plan to get close to him. Her emotional motivations were complex: though she loved him in part due to what her grandmother revealed about his past sacrifices, she also aimed to draw out his powers by evoking strong emotions, possibly even killing him to absorb what he held, which he indeed been wishing for.

As the tension climaxed, the setting warped into what resembled a courtroom—an abstract void with two opposing witness boxes. Atom stood in one, Kusam in the other. The rules were unknown but brutal: whoever delivered painful truths about the other would inflict damage, both psychological and physical.

Kusam began, recounting an alleged past where Atom stole possessions and sold them for petty business. The statement jolted Atom with electrical pain. She escalated her accusations, claiming that Atom always sought domination, once even hurting a mutual friend named Gurveer with a careless garbage throw, and that he enjoyed killing insects. Each assertion triggered increasingly violent shocks to Atom's body.

Then came a claim that Atom's vulgar thoughts had destroyed her childhood. This time, the attack failed. Atom defended himself, stating that he had no knowledge of such thoughts and was falsely accused. As he spoke, Kusam suffered a similar electric backlash. She continued, saying Atom created obscene cartoons and clay models, but Atom explained that his artworks always depicted genderless, blended anatomy—he didn't even understand what differentiated male from female at the time. His creations, misunderstood and mocked, were actually proof of his ignorance, not perversion.

Kusam reeled from the emotional and physical force of his rebuttal but managed one final claim: that Atom once chased after another girl named Gurenayat, then later shifted his interest to her, driven by desire. Atom admitted Gurenayat had once been a youthful crush, but Kusam's kindness had led him to momentarily admire her—only to later regret it when he saw her emotional distance. His avoidance of women was a choice rooted in respect, not lust.

The truth stunned the space around them. Kusam's form convulsed violently before combusting into flame. Atom, still standing, watched as the surreal courtroom dissolved. A swirl of energy spiralled into his hands, signifying the fusion of powers from both lineages.

Returning to the waking world, Atom sought out Dictator with a plea—to manage the unexplained disappearance of Kusam. Meanwhile, the narrative jumped back twelve years into the past, to a slum neighbourhood where a baby was born: Nishant Chaitanya, later to be known as Mr. Effort.`,
